                The moon is a celestial body that has fascinated humans for millennia, but despite its proximity and our many
                explorations of its surface, it still holds many secrets and unknown facts. For example, scientists have discovered that
                the moon experiences quakes, called moonquakes, which are caused by a variety of factors including the gravitational
                pull of Earth. Additionally, the moon has a thin atmosphere that contains traces of gases such as helium, neon, and
                argon. Over time, the moon is also slowly drifting away from Earth, at a rate of about 1.5 inches per year. There are
                also areas on the moon's surface that never receive sunlight, called "cold traps," which are thought to contain frozen
                water and other resources. Furthermore, the moon has an asymmetrical shape, with its far side having a thicker crust and
                higher elevation than the near side. Finally, the moon is not completely airless and is thought to have a small amount
                of ionized gas, or plasma, around its surface. These and other mysteries of the moon continue to fascinate scientists
                and inspire further research into our nearest celestial neighbor.
